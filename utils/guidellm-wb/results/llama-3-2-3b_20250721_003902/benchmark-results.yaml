        so. Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
        of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every
        moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and
        if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.
        Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!
        such an openness and gentleness in his manner. There certainly was some great
        mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the
        goodness, and the other all the appearance of it. I never thought Mr. Darcy
        so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do. And yet I meant
        to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any
        reason. It is such a spur to one s genius, such an opening for wit, to have
        a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything
        just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling
        on something witty. Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you
        could not treat the matter as you do now. Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable
        enough, I was very uncomfortable I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak
        to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very
        weak, and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you! How
        unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking
        of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved. Certainly.
        But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence
        of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want
        your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our
        acquaintance in general understand Wickham s character. Miss Bennet paused
        a little, and then replied, Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him
        so dreadfully. What is your own opinion? That it ought not to be attempted.
        Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public. On the contrary,
        every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible
        to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the

      prompt: such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough
        acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does
        not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting
        for her, when she first sees my aunt! We must endeavour to forget all that
        has passed on either side, said Jane I hope and trust they will yet be happy.
        His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to
        a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter
        myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may
        in time make their past imprudence forgotten. Their conduct has been such,
        replied Elizabeth, as neither you, nor I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It
        is useless to talk of it. It now occurred to the girls that their mother was
        in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the
        library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them
        to make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
        replied, Just as you please. May we take my uncle s letter to read to her?
        Take whatever you like, and get away. Elizabeth took the letter from his writing
        table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.
        Bennet one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation
        for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain
        herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner s hope of Lydia s being soon
        married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
        She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been
        fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married
        was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by
        any remembrance of her misconduct. My dear, dear Lydia! she cried this is
        delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be
        married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be I knew he
        would manage everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too!
        But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
        them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much

        of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or
        her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended
        to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
        received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits
        of her uncle and aunt from the city. With the Gardiners they were always on
        the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and
        they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons
        who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
        It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
        a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings
        or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this
        truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is
        considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
        My dear Mr. Bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that Netherfield
        Park is let at last? Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. But it is, returned
        she; for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it. Mr. Bennet
        made no answer. Do not you want to know who has taken it? cried his wife,
        impatiently. _You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.

        This was invitation enough. Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that
        Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;
        that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was
        so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that
        he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
        be in the house by the end of next week. What is his name? Bingley. Is he
        married or single? Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large
        fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls! How
        so? how can it affect them? My dear Mr. Bennet, replied his wife, how can

        of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille
        table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon
        reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself,
        and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and
        though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,
        it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability
        of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however,
        did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must
        be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,
        till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. If there had not been a
        Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would
        have been in a pitiable state at this time; for, from the day of the invitation
        to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their
        walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;
        the very shoe roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might
        have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
        improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a
        dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday
        endurable to Kitty and Lydia. Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield,
        and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled,
        a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting
        him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably
        have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared
        in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of
        his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of
        the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely
        omitted, for Mr. Darcy s pleasure, in the Bingleys invitation to the officers;
        and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence
        was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and

        bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed
        in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report
        which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict
        as a most scandalous falsehood. Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley
        was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.
        Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane s happiness,
        and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent
        its frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
        and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy
        and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength
        of his attachment. As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of
        course, more painful than Elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous
        of concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was
        never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom
        passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his
        arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she
        should think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane s steady mildness to
        bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. Mr. Collins returned most
        punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not
        quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy,
        however, to need much attention; and, luckily for the others, the business
        of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of
        every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn
        only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to
        bed. Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
        anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever
        she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was
        odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous

        Mrs. Gardiner, I begin to be of your uncle s opinion. It is really too great
        a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.
        I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly
        give him up, as to believe him capable of it? Not perhaps of neglecting his
        own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed,
        it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland,
        if that had been the case? In the first place, replied Mr. Gardiner, there
        is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland. Oh, but their removing
        from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides,
        no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road. Well, then, supposing
        them to be in London they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment,
        for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very
        abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more
        economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.
        But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage
        be private? Oh, no, no this is not likely. His most particular friend, you
        see by Jane s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
        Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it.
        And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health,
        and good humour, that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting
        himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace
        in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able
        to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.
        But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia
        has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father s behaviour,
        from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to

        our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must
        make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you
        will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything
        in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly. Elizabeth was
        eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks
        with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind
        attention she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins
        was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, It gives me the
        greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.
        We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power
        to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings,
        the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter
        ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our
        situation with regard to Lady Catherine s family is, indeed, the sort of extraordinary
        advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are.
        You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth, I must acknowledge,
        that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think
        anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our
        intimacy at Rosings. Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings;

        any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a
        subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned
        to him and said, Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
        well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?
        With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.
        You are severe on us. It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased, said Miss Lucas.
        I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows. You are
        a very strange creature by way of a friend! always wanting me to play and
        sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn,
        you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit
        down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.
        On Miss Lucas s persevering, however, she added, Very well; if it must be
        so, it must. And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, There is a very fine old saying,
        which everybody here is of course familiar with Keep your breath to cool your
        porridge, and I shall keep mine to swell my song. Her performance was pleasing,
        though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply
        to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded
        at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being
        the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments,
        was always impatient for display. Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though
        vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air
        and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence
        than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to

        accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire
        to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.
        From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and
        with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins s side, and as many bows
        on Sir William s, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door,
        Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she
        had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte s sake, she made more favourable
        than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble,
        could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take
        her Ladyship s praise into his own hands. Sir William stayed only a week at
        Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s
        being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such
        a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr.
        Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him
        the country but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual
        employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more
        of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
        and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
        and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted
        the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first
        had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for
        common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect but she
        soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr.
        Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they
        sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
        From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were
        indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and
        how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never
        failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She
        not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes conversation
        with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out. Very few days

        worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form
        a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The
        idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities
        towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit
        and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect
        of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that
        the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth,
        however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious
        dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make
        the offer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. If there
        had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss
        Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time; for, from the day
        of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain
        as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news
        could be sought after; the very shoe roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.
        Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which
        totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and
        nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday,
        Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia. Till Elizabeth entered the
        drawing room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the
        cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never
        occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any
        of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had
        dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for
        the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it
        was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant
        arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy
        s pleasure, in the Bingleys invitation to the officers; and though this was
        not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his
        friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham

        Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he
        could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began
        to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another, and
        never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
        a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large
        party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring
        twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved

        of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine
        figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley,
        and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till
        his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he
        was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased;
        and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most
        forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with
        his friend. Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
        people in the room he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry
        that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.
        Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between
        him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with
        Miss Bingley, declined

        of the family. She did not wait for him to speak, but began herself, "Tell

        she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.
        She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
        relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield
        was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner
        how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there. About a month, said Elizabeth;
        and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, he is a man of very large
        property in Derbyshire, I understand. Yes, replied Wickham; his estate there
        is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with
        a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than
        myself for I have been connected with his family, in a particular manner,
        from my infancy. Elizabeth could not but look surprised. You may well be surprised,
        Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the
        very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr.
        Darcy? As much as I ever wish to be, cried Elizabeth, warmly. I have spent
        four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable. I
        have no right to give _my_ opinion, said Wickham, as to his being agreeable
        or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and
        too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But
        I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and, perhaps, you
        would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your
        own family. Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house
        in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
        Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably
        spoken of by anyone. I cannot pretend to be sorry, said Wickham, after a short
        interruption, that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their
        deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded
        by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners,
        and sees him only as he chooses to be seen. I should take him, even on _my_
        slight acquaintance, to

        of Mrs. Bennet s ill humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same
        state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten
        his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was
        always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay. After
        breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned,
        and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on
        their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt s, where his regret
        and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over. To Elizabeth,
        however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_
        been self imposed. I found, said he, as the time drew near, that I had better
        not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for
        so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might
        arise unpleasant to more than myself. She highly approved his forbearance;
        and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendations
        which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
        walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended
        to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment
        it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing
        him to her father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered
        to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The
        envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered
        with a lady s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister s countenance
        change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
        Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to join,
        with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation but Elizabeth felt
        an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham;
        and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
        invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane,
        taking out her letter, said, This is from Caroline Bingley what it contains

      prompt: Bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage
        were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the
        occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of
        regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no
        reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she
        knew was deserved. The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar
        information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it. Four sides of paper
        were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
        being loved by her sister. Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins,
        or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard
        that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
        sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly
        angry by the contents of her nephew s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing
        in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such
        a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though
        in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly
        bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious
        civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He
        could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying
        away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their
        all meeting frequently at St. James s, with very decent composure. If he did
        shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight. Mrs. Philips
        s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his forbearance; and
        though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to
        speak with the familiarity which Bingley s good humour encouraged; yet, whenever
        she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it
        made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did
        all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever
        anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
        converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
        from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added
        to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
